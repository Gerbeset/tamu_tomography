# tamu_tomography
This respository contains python files that implement and test various tomography algorithms, including Radon X-ray CT tomography. This project was born in Dr. Kuchment's "Inverse Problems" at Texas A&amp;M University, where it was asked to convert a MATLAB script to python. The MATLAB script was originally written by Dr.  Leonid Kunyansky of U of AZ.
